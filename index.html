    <p>After living in Germany for 10 years, my parents informed my siblings and <br>
    I that we are moving to the United States for my dad's job. I had just finished <br>
    5th grade and I was devastated by this news. Not to mention, I couldn't speak <br>
    any English and I wasn't ready to lose all my friends and start from scratch. <br>
    When my first day of school arrived, I was terrified. The entire day, I didn't <br>
    understand anything people said to me. I used hand gestures the entire day to <br>
    communicate with teachers and other students. However, while the first couple <br>
    weeks were difficult, I soon recognized the numerous opportunities I had been <br>
    provided with by moving to the United States. Not only did I form countless new <br>
    friendships, but I was also fortunate to live in a country where every dream <br>
    could be turned into a reality. There are many aspects of living in the United <br>
    States that are not even a possibility in Germany. Therefore, even though moving <br>
    thousands of miles away from the only home I had ever known, I would never <br>
    exchange this experience for anything. A lot of times, people take opportunistic <br>
    situations for granted, not realizing the benefits they could gain from the <br>
    encounter. The main lesson I took away from this move is that it is critical that <br>
    us humans learn to enter every experience with an open mind. </p>

    <h2>The Struggle of Eating Healthy</h2>

    <p>As someone who did not grow up in the United States and was raised by the type <br>
    of parents that strictly limit their children's consumption of unhealthy foods, I <br>
    can confidently say that eating healthy in the United States is difficult. Not only <br>
    are most menu items filled with overwhelming amounts of fat and sodium, but there <br>
    are also many seemingly healthy options that are not all that healthy because <br>
    they are often fried or otherwise decreased in their nutritious value. Furthermore, <br>
    at most American households, there is an extreme lack of healthy meals and snacks. <br>
    Whenever I visit a friend's house, I make sure to eat before because I know I will <br>
    only be offered foods like pizza and chips. While it is completely fine to consume <br>
    such foods every once a while, they should not consume one's main diet. However, <br>
    the lack of effort and education about improving the United States' health only <br>
    enhances and normalizes this lifestyle. Moreover, now that I am in college and go <br>
    to the dining hall for all three meals, I have noticed the extreme lack of nutritious <br>
    options. While they have a salad bar and fruit station at every dining hall, there <br>
    is rarely a good selection of vegetables. When there are vegetables, they are often <br>
    plain and not seasoned well, further preventing students from consuming them. <br>
    Overall, I wish Americans invested more time and effort into providing tasty healthy <br>
    and snacks. If there were more nutritious food options, it would be much easier for <br>
    people to follow a more balanced diet. </p>
