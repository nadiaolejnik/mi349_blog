            <p>After living in Germany for 10 years, my parents informed my siblings and 
            I that we are moving to the United States for my dad's job. I had just finished 
            5th grade and I was devastated by this news. Not to mention, I couldn't speak 
            any English and I wasn't ready to lose all my friends and start from scratch. 
            When my first day of school arrived, I was terrified. The entire day, I didn't 
            understand anything people said to me. I used hand gestures the entire day to 
            communicate with teachers and other students. However, while the first couple 
            weeks were difficult, I soon recognized the numerous opportunities I had been 
            provided with by moving to the United States. Not only did I form countless new 
            friendships, but I was also fortunate to live in a country where every dream 
            could be turned into a reality. There are many aspects of living in the United 
            States that are not even a possibility in Germany. Therefore, even though moving 
            thousands of miles away from the only home I had ever known, I would never 
            exchange this experience for anything. A lot of times, people take opportunistic 
            situations for granted, not realizing the benefits they could gain from the 
            encounter. The main lesson I took away from this move is that it is critical that 
            us humans learn to enter every experience with an open mind. </p>

            <h3>The Struggle of Eating Healthy</h3>
            <address class="author"><a rel="author" href="https://twitter.com/NadiaOlejnik">Nadia Olejnik</a></address>
            <time datetime="2022-09-09" title="September 9th, 2022">Published September 9th, 2022</time>

            <p>As someone who did not grow up in the United States and was raised by the type 
            of parents that strictly limit their children's consumption of unhealthy foods, I 
            can confidently say that eating healthy in the United States is difficult. Not only 
            are most menu items filled with overwhelming amounts of fat and sodium, but there
            are also many seemingly healthy options that are not all that healthy because 
            they are often fried or otherwise decreased in their nutritious value. Furthermore, 
            at most American households, there is an extreme lack of healthy meals and snacks. 
            Whenever I visit a friend's house, I make sure to eat before because I know I will 
            only be offered foods like pizza and chips. While it is completely fine to consume 
            such foods every once a while, they should not consume one's main diet. However, 
            the lack of effort and education about improving the United States' health only 
            enhances and normalizes this lifestyle. Moreover, now that I am in college and go 
            to the dining hall for all three meals, I have noticed the extreme lack of nutritious
            options. While they have a salad bar and fruit station at every dining hall, there 
            is rarely a good selection of vegetables. When there are vegetables, they are often 
            plain and not seasoned well, further preventing students from consuming them. 
            Overall, I wish Americans invested more time and effort into providing tasty healthy 
            and snacks. If there were more nutritious food options, it would be much easier for 
            people to follow a more balanced diet. </p>
