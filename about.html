    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>I'm Nadia Olejnik and I am a sophomore at MSU majoring in Information Science. 
    I have two siblings called Julian and Elena. My brother is 23 and graduated from MSU 
    last December. My sister is 17 and is planning to attend MSU next fall.</p>

    <h2>Where Am I From?</h2>
    <p>While I was born in Michigan, I moved to Germany when I was 11  months old. Then, 
    when I was eleven, moved back to Michigan and have lived here ever since. Most of my 
    family still lives in Germany, therefore my family tries to visit at least once a year. 
    Overall, I am happy to live in Michigan, and I plan on living in the U.S. for the rest 
    of my life.

    <h2>My Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p>My hobbies and interests include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Playing tennis</li>
        <li>Traveling</li>
        <li>Working out</li>
        <li>Hanging out with friends</li>
        <li>Spending time outside</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Future Plans</h2>
    <p>In the future, I hope to become a User Experience Designer (UX Designer). From a young 
    age, I've been interested in design, as well as technology. Not to mention, I am a very 
    empathetic person, therefore, I think UX Design would be a great person. Developing products 
    based on improving the user's experience sounds fascinating and extremely rewarding to me. I 
    can't wait to start learning more about this career in my classes.
